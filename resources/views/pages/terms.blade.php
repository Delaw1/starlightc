All content uploaded to Starlightpremiumcontent by our users (Clients and Writers) is Agency Generated Content. Starlightpremiumcontent does not check user uploaded/created content for appropriateness, violations of copyright, trademarks, other rights or violations. We invite everyone to report violations together with proof of ownership as appropriate. Reported violating content may be removed or disabled.

        </ul>

        <strong>Ownership</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Ownership and limitations: When purchasing a Gig on Starlightpremiumcontent, unless clearly stated otherwise on the Agency's Gig page/description, when the work is delivered, and subject to payment, the Client is granted all intellectual property rights, including but not limited to, copyrights for the work delivered from the Writer, and the Writer waives any and all moral rights therein. The delivered work shall be considered work-for-hire under the U.S. Copyright Act. In the event the delivered work does not meet the requirements of work-for-hire or when US Copyright Act does not apply, the Writer expressly agrees to assign to Client the copyright in the delivered work. All transfer and assignment of intellectual property to Client shall be subject to full payment for the Gig and the delivery may not be used if payment is cancelled for any reason. For removal of doubt, in custom created work (such as art work, design work, report generation etc.), the delivered work shall be the exclusive property of Client, and Writer assigns all rights, title and interest in the delivered work. Some Gigs (including for custom created work) charge additional payments (through Gig Extras) for a Commercial Use License. This means that if you purchase the Gig for personal use, you will own all rights you require for such use, and will not need the Commercial Use License. If you intend to use it for any charge or other consideration, or for any purpose that is directly or indirectly in connection with any business, or other undertaking intended for profit, you will need to buy the Commercial Use License through a Gig Extra and will have broader rights that cover your business use.
            <li>Furthermore, users (both Clients and Writers) agree that unless they explicitly indicate otherwise, the content users voluntarily create/upload to Starlightpremiumcontent, including texts, photos, videos, usernames, user photos, user videos and any other information, including the display of delivered work, may be used by Starlightpremiumcontent for no consideration for marketing and/or other purposes.

        </ul>


        <strong>Gig Commercial Use License</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>By purchasing a “Commercial Use License” with your Gig Order, the Agency grants you a perpetual, exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license to use the purchased delivery for Permitted Commercial Purposes. For the avoidance of doubt, the Agency retains all ownership rights. “Permitted Commercial Purposes” means any business related use, such as (by way of example) advertising, promotion, creating web pages, integration into product, software or other business related tools etc., and strictly excludes any illegal, immoral or defamatory purpose. This License is subject to Starlightpremiumcontent’s Terms of Service. There is no warranty, express or implied, with the purchase of this delivery, including with respect to fitness for a particular purpose. Neither the Writer nor Starlightpremiumcontent will be liable for any claims, or incidental, consequential or other damages arising out of this license, the delivery or your use of the delivery.
