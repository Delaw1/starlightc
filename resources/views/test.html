                                <p>I am very pleased with the process of purchasing this car. The way the cars are presented on the website, the correct and fast way in which you manage to carry out the whole process, and the fast transport of the car, show that you are truly professional. The most important thing, however, is that the car is the real one, the one I chose, and not a cosmeticized one.</p>

This is a fantastic company that&#8217;s been around for a while. They specialise in high quality German cars, unusual and special imports. They have a reputation for outstanding quality, honesty, and integrity. I&#8217;ve enjoyed doing business here both times I bought from them. the buying process is easy, and I left with a great deal on my new (used) cars. I will certainly come back here again soonest because of the excellent customer service and high quality vehicles. Alex really knows his cars well, you won&#8217;t find a better car dealer  in Germany than Weckautos.</p>

I spent many months looking elsewhere and at WeckAuto Source before I bought from Alex. I have also brought three more sales to Alex and his staff. I plan on replacing my other vehicle at WeckAutos Source soon.</p>

He has diligently responded to all of my questions and concerns and has gone far above and beyond what anyone would ever expect. Alex has been nothing short of extremely professional and responsive. The car arrived yesterday and looks fantastic- I will be referring friends to him, despite the fact he is out of state, and definitely plan to purchase all future German vehicles from him.</p>
